## Overview
This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create predictive models that can assist banking institutions in targeting clients who are more likely to subscribe to term deposits. By accurately identifying potential subscribers, the institution can optimize its marketing efforts and improve campaign effectiveness.

## Results
The decision tree classifier achieved high accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions. The model effectively assists banking institutions in targeting clients likely to subscribe to term deposits, thereby optimizing marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in predicting term deposit subscriptions in direct marketing campaigns. By leveraging predictive analytics, banking institutions can enhance their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
